Description: This package takes a BAM or SAM file along with the corresponding
    reference genome and produces the precise alignment of one specific read or 
    all reads, according to the read's CIGAR string. If the file is a SAM file,
    the package will first convert it to a BAM file, which will be stored in the
    same directory as the BAM file. Functions will either omit NA values or
    return an error.
